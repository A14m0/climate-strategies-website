    "Caspar Ammann has 20+ years of experience in the field of analysis and modeling of global to regional climates across a range of timescales. As a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, he led the development of the Climate Risk Management engine (CRMe), a toolset designed to access, evaluate, and translate large climate archives into useful and usable products for applications in different sectors where they serve in climate risk screening and impacts assessments. Most recently, Caspar has assisted the World Bankâ€™s Climate Change Knowledge Portal (WB-CCKP) to upgrade the portal to the latest projections of climate change information and to broaden its products for more detailed analysis of climate variability and change.  He has a Ph.D. in Geosciences from the University of Massachusetts, and a Masters in Geography, Geology and Mineralogy from the University of Bern, Switzerland. ",
